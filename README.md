This is a project to use my knowledge on tsx, redux, material ui

It has three main components header, filters list and items list.

Search part in the header is working, it searchs through productName, category, brand etc.

From item list you can add items to basket with add to basket button, when you click on the basket icon, you will see the corresponding item in there,
and with the remove from basket button you can remove it from the basket.

Filters are working one by one.
